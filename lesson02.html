                <h3>Zillow</h3>

                <p>
                    Zillow repeatedly uses blue, white, and yellow/wood coulor. This 
                    is used to reinforce their brand and to give the user a sense of
                    cleanliness. The phrase, "Find it. Tour it. Own it." uses a 
                    repeating reference to your future house to make the user more
                    comfortable with the idea of buying/renting property from them.
                    Their headings use the same serif font and their input boxes 
                    and paragraphs use the same sans-serif font.
                </p>

            <div id="div2" class="content">
                <h2 class="contentTitle">Alignmnet</h2>
                <h3>Sitepoint</h3>
                <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/library">sitepoint.com</a>
                <img src="lesson2/images/sitepoint_screenshot.jpg" alt="MOBILE screenshot">
                <p>
                    The titles in each category of the library page adhere to both vertical
                    and horizontal alignmnet. Each section of the site uses the same margin 
                    on the right and left side of the screen, comfortably centering the 
                    content and justifying it to the left. They even placed the hamburger-menu
                    on the right side of the screen to make it easier to reach.

                <p>
                    Razer's website is full of contrast. The items being advertised are 
                    placed on a dark background to draw the attention to the RGB elements
                    of their products. Their titles and text-content are white or green 
                    and easily contrast with the background of their website or any RGB
                    effects in their advertisement. They use bold and completely capitalized
                    titles to contrast with their sans-serif text content.
