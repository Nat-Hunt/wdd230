        <h2>No serious injuries as storm passes through Elmore County</h2>
        <p>
          A tornado-warned storm in the early hours of Wednesday morning left
          several homes in southern Elmore County damaged or destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          On New Quarters Road in Tallassee a family got in the hallway just in
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‚ÄúThey huddled in there just as it hit,‚Äù a family member said. ‚ÄúThey
          got out fine but have lost everything.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          Friends and family were salvaging what belongings they could Wednesday
          morning. The family's rabbit was found but the dogs and cat were still
          lost. A pet turtle did not make it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The line of storms crossed Elmore County leaving a line of downed
          trees. U.S. Highway 231 in south Wetumpka had trees on it and crews
          with the Alabama Department of Transportation were out Wednesday
          cleaning it up. The line crossed over Jasmine Hill Road and Willow
          Springs Road damaging several homes and damaging utility poles. One
          homeowner found himself lucky. He had trees blown down but the only
          significant property damage was to a large bird bath.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‚ÄúWe were watching it on the phone,‚Äù the property owner said. ‚ÄúWe saw
          it in Prattville. We had lost power here. We heard the siren go off
          nearby and the phone too. We got to our safe spot just in time. It was
          like five to seven seconds of chaos then it just went silent.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          By 9 a.m. the driveway was passable but lots of work will be needed to
          clean up the yard.
        </p>
